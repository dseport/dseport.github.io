<h1>Beetles</h1>
<p>
Beetles are incredibly diverse, representing 40 percent of all described insect species on Earth. 
Fossil records indicate that beetles were abundant during the Mesozoic period roughly 200 million years ago. 
Flowing plants first appeared in the Early Cretaceous period over 100 million years ago, 
well before the existence of other insect pollinators, and beetles were likely the very first. 
The pollination of plants by beetles is known as coleopterophily. 
This term comes from the taxonomic order that beetles belong to, Coleoptera, 
and the Greek -philia, which means love or affinity. 
These plants typically bloom during the day with flowers that are large and thick, 
as well as heavily scented. 
Beetles are not specialized pollinators and will feed on all parts of a plant, 
pollinating them as they go.

<p>
<i>Strangalia luteicornis</i> is a species of longhorn beetle in North America known to pollinate native magnolia flowers. 
Magnolias were among the first flowering plants to evolve millions of years ago and are exclusively pollinated by different species of beetles.
