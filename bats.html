<h1>Bats</h1>
<p>
Bats are key pollinators in tropical and desert climates. 
More than 500 species of plants worldwide are pollinated by bats. 
Plants of these species tend to be located few and far between in these climates, 
and bats are able to travel these long distances compared to other pollinators. 
The pollination of plants by bats is known as chiropterophily. 
This term comes from the taxonomic order that bats belong to, Chiroptera, 
and the Greek -philia, which means love or affinity. 
These plants typically bloom at night with pale flowers that are large and bell-shaped. 
Bats feed on the nectar within the flowers, as well as the resulting fruit of these plants.

<i>Leptonycteris nivalis</i>, the Mexican long-nosed bat or greater long-nosed bat, is one of a few bats that are the primary pollinators of several species of agave in Mexico. 
Agave is an important cash crop used to make tequila and mezcal.
