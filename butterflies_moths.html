<h1>Butterflies and Moths</h1>
<p>
Both butterflies and moths belong to the same taxonomic order of insect: Lepidoptera. 
They represent 10 percent of all described insect species on Earth, the second largest group of insects behind beetles. 
There are an estimated ten times more moth species than there are butterfly species. 
Butterflies and moths pollinate many wildflowers, although not as efficiently as other pollinators, 
as they do not feed on and have no specialized features to carry pollen. While feeding on nectar, 
they incidentally pick up pollen on their bodies that they carry to the many flowers they visit.
